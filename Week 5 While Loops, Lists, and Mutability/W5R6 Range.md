# range

### The Built-in Function: range

Python has a built-in function called `range` that is useful to use when you want to generate a sequence of numbers. You can type `help(range)` in IDLE if you ever need a reminder.

The example below will print the integers 0 to 9, inclusive.

<pre>for i in range(10):
    print (i)
</pre>

The form of `range` is:

<pre>range([start,] stop[, step]):
    return a virtual sequence of numbers from start to stop by step
</pre>

### Applications of Range

There are other options you can specify to `range`. One option is to let range generate the numbers corresponding to indices of a string or a list.

<pre>s = 'computer science'
for i in range(len(s)):
    print(i)
</pre>

You can also tell `range` what index to start at. For instance, the example below starts at index 1 (as opposed to the default which is 0).

<pre>for i in range(1, len(s)):
	print(i)
</pre>

You can even specify the "step" for `range`. The default stepping size is 1, which means that numbers increment by 1\. The example below starts at index 1 and its step size is there (goes to every third index).

<pre>for i in range(1, len(s), 3):
    print(i)
</pre>
