# Type `list`

### Overview

Our programs will often work with collections of data. One way to store these collections of data is using Python's type `list`.

The general form of a list is:

<pre>[expr1, expr2, ..., exprN]
</pre>

For example, here is a list of three grades:

<pre>grades = [80, 90, 70]
</pre>

### List Operations

Like strings, lists can be indexed:

<pre>>>> grades[0]
80
>>> grades[1]
90
>>> grades[2]
70

</pre>

Lists can also be sliced, using the same notation as for strings:

<pre>>>> grades[0:2]
[80, 90]

</pre>

The `in` operator can also be applied to check whether a value is an item in a list.

<pre>>>> 90 in grades
True
>>> 60 in grades
False

</pre>

Several of Python's built-in functions can be applied to lists, including:

*   `len(list)`: return the length of `list`.
*   `min(list)`: return the smallest element in `list`.
*   `max(list)`: return the largest element in `list`.
*   `sum(list)`: return the sum of elements of `list` (where list items must be numeric).

For example, here are some calls to those built-in functions:

<pre>>>> len(grades)
3
>>> min(grades)
70
>>> max(grades)
90
>>> sum(grades)
240

</pre>

### Types of list elements

Lists elements may be of any type. For example, here is a `list of str`:

<pre>subjects = ['bio', 'cs', 'math', 'history']
</pre>

Lists can also contain elements of more than one type. For example, a street address can be represented by a `list of [int, str]`:

<pre>street_address = [10, 'Main Street']
</pre>

### `for` loops over `list`

Similar to looping over the characters of a string, it is possible to iterate over the elements of a list. For example:

<pre>>>> for grade in grades:
    print(grade)
80
90
70

</pre>

The general form of a `for` loop over a `list` is:

<pre>for _variable_ in _list_:
    _body_

</pre>
