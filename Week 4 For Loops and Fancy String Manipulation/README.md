# For Loops and Fancy String Manipulation

This module introduces one way to repeat code (using a for loop), how to manipulate strings, and how to use a debugger to watch a program execute step by step.

### Learning Objectives

*   Predict what expressions involving string indexing and slicing will produce.
*   Explain how comparison operators work when comparing strings.
*   Give_examples of string method calls and their results.
*   Develop a for loop over a string.
*   Practice using IDLE's debugger to examine the intermediate states of program execution.
