# Visualizing Assignment Statements

### Optional Reading:

*   2.4 Variables and Computer Memory: Remembering Values
*   3.2 Memory Addresses: How Python Keeps Track of Values

On the Resources page is a link to a Python Visualizer that follows the model we use to draw pictures of computer memory.

Consider this code:

<pre>x = 1
y = x + 2
x = 7
</pre>

When we trace this in the visualizer and click button Forward twice, this is the result:

Clicking Forward once more results in this:

Notice that `y`'s value did not change during this step.

Here is [a link to the Python Visualizer](http://tinyurl.com/mpy3uxn) containing this code so that you can explore this yourself. **We strongly encourage you to step forward and backward through this program until you understand every step of execution.**
