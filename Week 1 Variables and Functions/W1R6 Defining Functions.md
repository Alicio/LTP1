# Defining Functions

### Optional Reading:

*   Chaper 3.3 Defining Our Own Functions
*   Chaper 3.4 Using Local Variables for Temporary Storage
*   Chaper 3.7 Writing and Running a Program

### Function Definitions

The general form of a function definition:

* * *

<pre>def function_name(parameters):
    body
</pre>

* * *

*   `def`: a keyword indicating a function definition
*   function_name: the function name
*   parameters:
    *   the parameter(s) of the function, 0 or more and are separated by a comma
    *   a parameter is a variable whose value will be supplied when the function is called
*   body:
    *   1 or more statements, often ending with a `return` statement

Example of a function definition:

<pre>def f(x):
    return x ** 2
</pre>

### `return` statement

The general form of a `return` statement:

* * *

<pre>return expression
</pre>

* * *

The rules for executing a `return` statement:

1.  Evaluate the expression. This produces a memory address.
2.  Pass back that memory address to the caller. Exit the function.

### Function Calls

Function calls are expressions and the result can be stored in a variable.

The general form of a function call:

* * *

<pre>function_name(arguments)
</pre>

* * *

The rules for executing a function call:

1.  Evaluate the arguments to produce memory addresses.
2.  Store those memory addresses in the corresponding parameters.
3.  Execute the body of the function.

* * *

Example of a function definition and function calls:

<pre>>>> def area(base, height):
    return base * height / 2
>>> area(3, 4)
6.0
>>> result = area(10, 7.45)
>>> result
37.25
</pre>

### Saving your programs to ".py" files

We usually save our Python programs in ".py" files. A file can contain multiple function definitions and other statements. Before calling a function from a ".py" file in the shell in IDLE, you need to first execute Run -> Run Module, or else the shell will not recognize the function call.
