### Assignment statements

The general form of an assignment statement:

> _`variable = expression`_

Example assignment statements:

> <pre>>>> base = 20
> >>> height = 12
> >>> area = base * height / 2
> >>> area
> 120.0
> </pre>

The rules for executing an assignment statement:

1.  Evaluate the expression. This produces a memory address.
2.  Store the memory address in the variable.

### Variable names

The rules for legal Python names:

1.  Names must start with a letter or `_`.
2.  Names must contain only letters, digits, and `_`.

For Python, in most situations, the convention is to use `pothole_case`.
