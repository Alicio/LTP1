# Type `str`: Strings in Python

### String Literal

A _string literal_ is a sequence of characters. In Python, this type is called `str`. Strings in Python start and end with a single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). A string can be made up of letters, numbers, and special characters. For example:

<pre>>>> 'hello'
'hello'
>>> 'how are you?'
'how are you?'
>>> 'short- and long-term'
short- and long-term
</pre>

If a string begins with a single quote, it must end with a single quote. The same applies to double-quoted strings. You can not mix the type of quotes.

### Escape Sequences

To include a quote within a string, use an _escape character_ (`\`) before it. Otherwise Python interprets that quote as the end of a string and an error occurs. For example, the following code results in an error because Python does not expect anything to come after the second quote:

<pre>>>> storm_greeting = 'wow, you're dripping wet.'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</pre>

The _escape sequence_ `\'` indicates that the second quote is simply a quote, not the end of the string:

<pre>>>> storm_greeting = 'Wow, you\'re dripping wet.'
"Wow, you're dripping wet."
</pre>

An alternative approach is to use a double-quoted string when including a a single-quote within it, or vice-versa. Single- and double-quoted strings are equivalent. For example, when we used double-quotes to indicate the beginning and end of the string, the single-quote in `you're` no longer causes an error:

<pre>>>> storm_greeting = "Wow, you're dripping wet."
"Wow, you're dripping wet."
</pre>

### String Operators

| Expression | Description | Example | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `str1 + str2` | concatenate `str1` and `str1` | `print('ab' + 'c')` | `abc` |
| `str1 * int1` | concatenate `int1` copies of `str1` | `print('a' * 5)` | `aaaaa` |
| `int1 * str1` | concatenate `int1` copies of `str1` | `print(4 * 'bc')` | `bcbcbcbc` |

Note: _concatenate_ means to join together

The `*` and `+` operands obey by the standard precedence rules when used with strings.

All other mathematical operators and operands result in a `TypeError`.
