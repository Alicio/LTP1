# Type `bool`: Booleans in Python

### Optional Reading:

*   Chapter 5.1 A Boolean Type

### Boolean values

The Python type `bool` has two values: `True` and `False`.

### Comparison operators

The comparison operators take two values and produce a Boolean value.

| Description | Operator | Example | Result of example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| less than | `<` | `3 < 4` | `True` |
| greater than | `>` | `3 > 4` | `False` |
| equal to | `==` | `3 == 4` | `False` |
| greater than or equal to | `>=` | `3 >= 4` | `False` |
| less than or equal to | `<=` | `3 <= 4` | `True` |
| not equal to | `!=` | `3 != 4` | `True` |

### Logical operators

There are also three logical operators that produce Boolean values: `and`, `or`, and `not`.

| Description | Operator | Example | Result of example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| not | `not` | `not (80 >= 50)` | `False` |
| and | `and` | `(80 >= 50) and (70 <= 50)` | `False` |
| or | `or` | `(80 >= 50) or (70 <= 50)` | `True` |

### The `and` Logic Table

The `and` operator produces `True` if and only if both expressions are `True`.

As such, if the first operand is `False`, the second condition will not even be checked, because it is already known that the expression will produce `False`.

| `_expr1_` | `_expr2_` | `_expr1_ and _expr2_` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `True` | `True` | `True` |
| `True` | `False` | `False` |
| `False` | `True` | `False` |
| `False` | `False` | `False` |

### The `or` Logic Table

The `or` operator evaluates to `True` if and only if at least one operand is `True`.

As such, if the first operand is `True`, the second condition will not even be checked, because it is already known that the expression will produce `True`.

| `_expr1_` | `_expr2_` | `_expr1_ or _expr2_` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `True` | `True` | `True` |
| `True` | `False` | `True` |
| `False` | `True` | `True` |
| `False` | `False` | `False` |

### The `not` Logic Table

The `not` operator evaluates to `True` if and only if the operand is `False`.

| `_expr1_` | `not _expr1_` |
| --- | --- |
| `True` | `False` |
| `False` | `True` |

Double-negation can be simplified. For example, the expression `not not (4 == 5)` can be simplified to `4 == 5`.

### Order of Precedence for Logical Operators

The order of precedence for logical operators is: `not`, `and`, then `or`. We can override precedence using parentheses and parentheses can also be added to make things easier to read and understand.

For example, the `not` operator is applied before the `or` operator in the following code:

<pre>>>> grade = 80
>>> grade2 = 90
>>> not grade >= 50 or grade2 >= 50
True
</pre>

Parentheses can be added to make this clearer: `(not grade >= 50) or (grade2 >= 50)`

Alternatively, parentheses can be added to change the order of operations: `not ((grade >= 50) or (grade2 >= 50))`
