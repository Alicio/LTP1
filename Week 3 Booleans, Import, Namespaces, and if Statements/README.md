# Booleans, Import, Namespaces, and if Statements

This module introduces Booleans (logical values True and False), how to convert between types, how to use Boolean expressions in if statements to selectively run code, and the concept of a Python module.

### Learning Objectives

*   Predict what value a Boolean expression produces.
*   Explain the rules Python uses to find a variable in computer memory.
*   Create a memory model stack frame and associated variables and values.
*   Develop if statements to accomplish a program requirement.
*   Compare two different if statements for similarity.
