# Import: Using Non-Builtin Functions

### Optional Reading:

*   6.1 Importing Modules
*   6.2 Defining Your Own Modules

### Modules

Python contains many functions, but not all of them are immediately available as builtin functions. Instead of being available as builtins, some functions are saved in different modules. A _module_ is a file containing function definitions and other statements.

We may also define our own modules with our own functions.

### `import`

In order to gain access to the functions in a module, we must import that module.

The general form of an import statement is:

<pre>import module_name
</pre>

To access a function within a module, we use:

<pre>module_name.function_name
</pre>

For example, we can import the Python module `math` and call the function `sqrt` from it:

<pre>import math

def area2(side1, side2, side3):
        semi = semiperimeter(side1, side2, side3)
        area = math.sqrt(semi * (semi - side1) * (semi - side2) * (semi - side3))
        return area
</pre>

In addition to importing Python's modules, we can also import the modules that we write. For example, to use the functions from `triangle.py` (from the video) in another module, we would `import triangle`. A module being imported should be in the same directory as the module importing it.
